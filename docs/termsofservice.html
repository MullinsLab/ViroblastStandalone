<strong>Acceptance of Terms</strong>
<p>
The ViroBLAST Server ("ViroBLAST") is available to you subject to the Terms of Service described on this page. 
Your use of ViroBLAST constitutes your agreement to these terms and conditions.

<p>
<strong>Purpose of ViroBLAST</strong>
<p>
ViroBLAST was designed to facilitate data analysis, and provides sequence comparison and contamination checking 
for viral research. ViroBLAST was developed through funding support from Advanced Technology Initiative in Infectious 
Diseases at University of Washington and US Public Health Service grants to Dr. James I. Mullins (AI047734, AI57005, AI058894) 
as well as the University of Washington Center for AIDS Research (AI27757). It is managed by Dr. James I. Mullins in the 
Department of Microbiology, University of Washington. ViroBLAST serves the University of Washington's mission to disseminate 
knowledge in the public interest. This information is provided on the following terms and conditions.

<p>
<strong>Privacy Policy</strong>
<p>
University of Washington is an agency of the State of Washington and as such has obligations to maintain public records 
under RCW 42, which potentially requires us to provide ViroBLAST log files and data records if requested by anyone through 
the proper process.
<p>
We collect information about your computer such as its IP address and the version of your web browser software in order 
to make aggregate reports of usage to our funding agencies and to improve ViroBLAST.

<p>

ViroBLAST is intended for your educational or research purposes. All materials and services provided by ViroBLAST are 
protected by copyright or other intellectual property rights, and owned or controlled by the University of Washington,

You may download or copy the results from your use of ViroBLAST, provided that you maintain all copyright notices and 
other notices contained therein. Other material on ViroBLAST is subject to the conditions stated therein.
<p>
<strong>Confidentiality</strong>
<p>
All data submitted to ViroBLAST may become publicly accessible, and the University of Washington does not guarantee 
confidentiality. Uploaded sequence data are stored for the duration of your query, and then automatically deleted. The 
resulting alignments, which may contain uploaded sequences, remain accessible on the server for 48 hours via a randomized 
URL specific to your query.
<p>
<strong>Modification to Terms of Service</strong>
<p>
The University of Washington reserves the right to change these Terms of Service. The current Terms of Service will 
always be posted at ViroBLAST. The University of Washington reserves the right to suspend maintenance or service of ViroBLAST 
at any time and without notice.

OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF TITLE, NONINFRINGEMENT OF INTELLECTUAL 
PROPERTY, AND IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
<p>
<strong>Limitation of Liability</strong>
<p>
The entire risk for use of ViroBLAST lies with the user. The University of Washington reserves the right to modify 
ViroBLAST or reduce or discontinue ViroBLAST at any time. ViroBLAST is provided for educational and informational purposes
